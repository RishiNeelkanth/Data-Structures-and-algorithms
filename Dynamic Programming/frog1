Ques : Frog1

There are N stones, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), the height of Stone i is hi
There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

Sample Input 1 
Copy
4
10 30 40 20
Sample Output 1 
Copy
30
If we follow the path 1 → 2 → 4, the total cost incurred would be ∣10−30∣+∣30−20∣=30.

Sample Input 2 
Copy
2
10 10
Sample Output 2 
Copy
0
If we follow the path 1 → 2, the total cost incurred would be ∣10−10∣=0.

Sample Input 3 
Copy
6
30 10 60 10 60 50
Sample Output 3 
Copy
40
If we follow the path 1 → 3 → 5 → 6, the total cost incurred would be ∣30−60∣+∣60−60∣+∣60−50∣=40.
