Ques : Articulation Point 


We are given an undirected graph. An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which, when removed along with associated edges, makes the graph
disconnected (or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph). The task is to find all articulation points in the given graph.
The algorithm described here is based on depth first search and has O(N+M) complexity, where N is the number of vertices and M is the number of edges in the graph.


CODE : 

int n; // number of nodes
vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency list of graph

vector<bool> visited;
vector<int> tin, low;
int timer;

void dfs(int v, int p = -1) {
    visited[v] = true;
    tin[v] = low[v] = timer++;
    int children=0;
    for (int to : adj[v]) {
        if (to == p) continue;
        if (visited[to]) {
            low[v] = min(low[v], tin[to]);
        } else {
            dfs(to, v);
            low[v] = min(low[v], low[to]);
            if (low[to] >= tin[v] && p!=-1)
                IS_CUTPOINT(v);
            ++children;
        }
    }
    if(p == -1 && children > 1)
        IS_CUTPOINT(v);
}

void find_cutpoints() {
    timer = 0;
    visited.assign(n, false);
    tin.assign(n, -1);
    low.assign(n, -1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i])
            dfs (i);
    }
}
