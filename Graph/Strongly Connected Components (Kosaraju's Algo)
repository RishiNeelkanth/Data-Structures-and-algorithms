QUES: Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algo) 

Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, Find the number of strongly connected components in the graph.
 
->Example 1:
Input:
Output:
3
Explanation:

We can clearly see that there are 3 Strongly
Connected Components in the Graph

->Example 2:
Input:
Output:
1
Explanation:
All of the nodes are connected to each other.
So, there's only one SCC.
