Ques: Euler Circuit in an Undirected Graph 

Eulerian Path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex. 
Given the number of vertices V and adjacency list adj denoting the graph. Your task is to find that there exists the Euler circuit or not
**Note that: Given graph is connected.

->Example 1:
Input: 
Output: 1
Explanation: One of the Eularian circuit 
starting from vertex 0 is as follows:
0->1->3->2->0

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    
	bool isEularCircuitExist(int V, vector<int>adj[]){
	    for(int i=0;i<V;i++)
	    {
	        if(adj[i].size()%2!=0)
	        {
	            return false;
	        }
	    }
	    return true;
	}

};
