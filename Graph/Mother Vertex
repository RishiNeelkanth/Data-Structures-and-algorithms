QUES:Mother Vertex 

Given a Directed Graph, find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (if present). 
A Mother Vertex is a vertex through which we can reach all the other vertices of the Graph.
 

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: According to the given edges, all 
nodes can be reaced from nodes from 0, 1 and 2. 
But, since 0 is minimum among 0,1 and 3, so 0 
is the output.
Example 2:

Input: 

Output: -1
Explanation: According to the given edges, 
no vertices are there from where we can 
reach all vertices. So, output is -1.
 
 CODE:
 
 class Solution 
{
    public:
    void dfs(int i,int &count,vector<int> adj[],vector<int>& vis)
    {
        vis[i]=1;
        count++;
        for(auto it : adj[i])
        {
            if(!vis[it])
            {
                dfs(it,count,adj,vis);
            }
        }
    }
    //Function to find a Mother Vertex in the Graph.
	int findMotherVertex(int V, vector<int>adj[])
	{
	    vector<int> vis(V,0);
	    for(int i=0;i<V;i++)
	    {
	        int count=0;
	        if(!vis[i])
	        {
	            dfs(i,count,adj,vis);
	        }
	    if(V==count)
	    return i;
	    }
	    return -1;
	}
};
