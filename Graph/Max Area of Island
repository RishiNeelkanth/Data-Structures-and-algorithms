Ques:Max Area of Island

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.


CODE:
***DFS

class Solution {
public:

    int n, m;
    int trav(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= n || j >= m || !grid[i][j]) return 0;
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        return 1 + trav(i-1, j, grid) + trav(i, j-1, grid) + trav(i+1, j, grid) + trav(i, j+1, grid);
    }

    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int ans = 0;
        n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
                if (grid[i][j]) ans = max(ans, trav(i, j, grid));
        return ans;
    }
};
