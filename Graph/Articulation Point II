QUES : Articulation Point - II

Given an undirected graph (not necessarily connected) with V vertices and adjacency list adj. You are required to find all the vertices removing which 
(and edges through it) disconnects the graph into 2 or more components, or in other words, removing which increases the number of connected components.
Note: Indexing is zero-based i.e nodes numbering from (0 to V-1). There might be loops present in the graph.
