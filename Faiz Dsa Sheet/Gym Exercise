QUES : 
Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in 
the gym. Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.
You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have 
to perform such that you become tired. Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as 
others also have to use the machines.
If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.



CODE:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int exercise(int arr[], int test, int energy){
    
    //check if some input == energy , if yess then return 1.
    for(int i =0; i<test; i++){
        if(arr[i] >= energy){
            return 1;
        }
    }
    int sum =0;
    int ans =0;
    int ans1=0;
    for(int i=0; i<test; i++){ 
        sum = sum + arr[i]; 
        if(sum >=energy){
            ans = i+1;
            return ans;
        }
    }
    sum =0;
    for(int i =0; i<test; i++){ 
        sum = sum + arr[i]; 
        if(2*sum >= energy){
            ans1 = 2*(i+1);
            return ans1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
int main()
{
 int energy ;
 cin>>energy;
 int test;
 cin>>test;
  
  int arr[test];
  for(int i =0; i<test; i++){ 
      cin>> arr[i];
  }
  
 int ans = exercise(arr, test, energy);
 cout << ans;
  
}
